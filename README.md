This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to the unit testing strategy for the AnkaraLab_BackEnd project, focusing on validating the functionality and reliability of the Client domain model and its associated ClientsController. The documentation outlines the structure and purpose of the tests written in ClientTests.cs and ClientsControllerTests.cs, ensuring developers understand the testing approach and can extend or maintain it as needed.

## ClientTests.cs Documentation
### Overview
ClientTests.cs contains unit tests for the Client domain model in the AnkaraLab_BackEnd.WebAPI.Domain namespace. These tests verify the presence and correctness of annotations on properties, ensuring that model validation behaves as expected.

### Tests
#### Key Attributes
* Client_Id_ShouldHaveKeyAttribute: Ensures the Id property is decorated with the [Key] attribute, marking it as the primary key.
* Client_Id_ShouldHaveDatabaseGeneratedAttribute: Verifies the Id property has the [DatabaseGenerated] attribute, indicating its value is generated by the database.
#### Required Properties
Client_RequiredProperties_ShouldHaveRequiredAttribute: Checks if essential properties (Name, Surname, Email, Password) have the [Required] attribute, enforcing their presence for model validity.
#### Optional Properties
Client_Discount_ShouldNotHaveRequiredAttribute: Confirms the Discount property does not have the [Required] attribute, marking it as optional.
#### Property Types
Client_LastLoginDate_ShouldHaveDateTimeType: Assures the LastLoginDate property is of DateTime type, suitable for storing date and time values.
#### Default Values
* Client_Newsletter_ShouldHaveDefaultValueFalse: Checks the default value of the Newsletter boolean property is false.
* Client_IsActive_ShouldHaveDefaultValueTrue: Ensures the IsActive boolean property defaults to true.
* Client_IsAdmin_ShouldHaveDefaultValueFalse: Verifies the IsAdmin boolean property is false by default.

## ClientControllerTests.cs Documentation
### Overview
ClientsControllerTests.cs focuses on testing the ClientsController, part of the AnkaraLab_BackEnd.WebAPI.Controllers namespace. It evaluates the controller's ability to handle CRUD operations correctly, utilizing mock objects for dependencies like repositories and loggers.

### Setup
Mocks are used for the following dependencies:

* IClientRepository: To simulate database operations without hitting an actual database.
* IMapper: To mock the mapping between domain models and DTOs.
* ILogger<ClientsController>: To mock logging actions.

### Tests
#### Retrieving Clients
* GetClients_ReturnsOkResult: Tests that requesting a list of clients returns an OkObjectResult with a non-null value, indicating a successful operation.
* GetClient_ReturnsOkResultForValidId: Verifies that retrieving a single client by a valid ID returns an OkObjectResult with a non-null value, confirming the client's details are fetched correctly.
#### Deleting Clients
DeleteClient_ReturnsOkResultForValidId: Assesses the controller's ability to delete a client by a valid ID, expecting an OkObjectResult to confirm the operation's success.
### Conclusion
These unit tests serve as a foundational aspect of ensuring the AnkaraLab_BackEnd project's Client model and ClientsController function as expected. By meticulously testing model annotations and controller actions, the tests contribute to the overall reliability and maintainability of the project. Future development should continue to extend this testing approach, incorporating new functionality and scenarios as the application evolves.
